    """
    From the original `.npy` file of madevent data, randomly chooses events and
    saves them in a (N, N_fsp, 4) numpy array as a `.npz` file where N is the
    number of events and N_fsp is the number of final state particles. The
    invariant masses distribution of the events isn't uniform, so we use the
    inverse CDF to create a uniform distribution of invariant masses. We choose
    iteratively from the invariant mass bins and then join them all together
    into one big array.

    Parameters:
    evts_fname - The name of the file with all the events in it to pull from.
    N - Number of events per invariant mass bin.
    mass_norm - The mass to normalize the invariant masses by. It should be the
        sum of the masses of the two parent particles.
    invm_bins (default None) - If None, the bins are from the `INVMS` constant,
        i.e. [1.00. 1.25], then [1.25, 1.50], then [1.50, 1.75], etc. Otherwise,
        the bins can be specified as a list of tuples.
    N_fsp (default None) - The number of final state particles. Only used if
        the numpy array loaded in isn't already split up into per-particle
        4-momenta. If the array is, then this isn't needed.
    prec_bins (default 500) - The number of bins used to split up the invariant
        masses to give a probability to each event of randomly choosing it. A
        higher probability means that the event's invariant mass is in a bin
        with a small number of events (such that those events are boosted to
        create the uniform distribution). Too small and the uniform distribution
        is less approximated and too large, there aren't enough events per bin.
