    """
    From the original `.npy` file of madevent data, randomly chooses events and
    saves them in a (N, N_fsp, 4) numpy array as a `.npz` file where N is the
    number of events and N_fsp is the number of final state particles. The
    invariant masses distribution of the events isn't uniform, so we use the
    inverse CDF to create a uniform distribution of invariant masses. We choose
    iteratively from the invariant mass bins and then join them all together
    into one big array.

    Parameters:
    N - Number of events per invariant mass bin.
    invm_bins (default None) - If None, the bins are from the `INVMS` constant,
        i.e. [1.00. 1.25], then [1.25, 1.50], then [1.50, 1.75], etc. Otherwise,
        the bins can be specified as a list of tuples.
    etype (default "ttbar") - The event type, currently can be "ttbar", "tW" or
        "6jet".
    dtype (default "parton") - The data type, currently can be "parton" or
        "smeared".
    prec_bins (default 500) - The number of bins used to split up the invariant
        masses to give a probability to each event of randomly choosing it. A
        higher probability means that the event's invariant mass is in a bin
        with a small number of events (such that those events are boosted to
        create the uniform distribution). Too small and the uniform distribution
        is less approximated and too large, there aren't enough events per bin.
